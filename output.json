    "body": "Updated: November 18, 2016\r\nBy: Steve Schmidt \r\n\r\nFishing Conditions Summary:\r\nNovember keeps on producing some of the fall's best fly-fishing opportunities.  We're on borrowed time, but we're enjoying what November has had to offer while it lasts. River conditions remain unchanged and the weather's going to be more to our liking.  Looking ahead into the upcoming forecast we're cooling off and there are a few more clouds around after a brief flurry passes by.  After the moisture moves on to the east it's going to warm up and dry out leaving us with some lingering clouds.  That will take us into Turkey Day.  We're still seeing BWO's and some caddis and on the right day they've been pretty good.  Blue Wings haven't gotten any bigger since my last report.  They are running sizes #22-#24 and challenging to see especially for us old guys, but that's part of what has made our late season fishing enjoyable.  Not necessarily the small part, but our rivers trout are pretty picky at this late juncture in the year so it's been a pretty fun game seeing what dry flies we can get them to eat. If any at all.... So be prepared to have to earn your keep. At this late juncture in the season size does matter whether it's your tippet material or your fly patterns. \r\n\r\nNo changes regarding water conditions from my last few reports.  Water levels on all our streams for the most part are normal for this time of year.  In general they are quite low, in particular the Weber.  On the Weber we feel it's so low we're encouraging people to stay away in order to maintain the overall long term health of that fishery.  Other than the Weber, all other fisheries are in good shape or normal for November. BWO's are still a factor and other than some late season caddis hatches that are getting some attention on the Middle Provo. That about sums up November bugs and flows. \r\n\r\nNovember has been kind to us on one front, but also brutally void of some much needed moisture. It's a little scary out there regarding temps and our water conditions.  As far as we're concerned it can start raining and snowing anytime.  We're ready for some cold and miserable weather.  I know the ski resorts would be stoked and so would our trout. In closing since I'm getting ready to take a break check out Closing Comments.  I've written a brief summary of the year's hatches and in general what you can expect in 2017 from start to finish. Check it out.....#wrflyfisher #keepumwet.   \r\n\r\nFlows: \r\nGreen River flows are unchanged. They are still running on average about 1500 ft3/s for daily flows.  Through the peak part of the fishing day flows are running about 1100 ft3/s.  After 6p At about 5 they start to ramp up, and go up quiet quickly.  If you're down around Little Hole those flows will hit about the time it gets dark.  Perfect timing.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Provo dropped to 150 ft3/s, which is it's winter level.    The Lower Provo is normal for this time of year and running at 100 ft3/s. I did mention that these flows would drop, and they did.  \r\n \r\nThe Weber is at 33 ft3/s out of Rockport.  This is lower than what I'd like for the Weber so I'm going to stay away from it until flows come up in the spring.   \r\n\r\nProvo River:\r\nAs we enter the last half of November both the Middle and Lower Provo continue to fish as they have for much of the fall; pretty good. With some cloudy days back in the forecast we should see some decent hatches even at this late juncture in the year. We're on the downside of bug life and our fly-fishing season on the Provo River, but due to a number of things the mayfly hatches are still better than usual for November and coincidentally so is the fishing.  \r\n\r\nBlue Wing hatches are generating the most consistent overall fishing, regarding hatches on both sections of the Provo and when this hatch ends we'll probably be done for the year regarding hatches and dry fly fishing opportunities.  Even though fishing's going to really slow down in the near future, you'll still be able to take a fish or two with nymphs, possibly even streamers, but once fall hatches finish up our opportunities will significantly diminish. I think we're a week or two away from that given the continued mild weather we're having, but at this late juncture in the year we're taking it day by day an enjoying the opportunity to still find some decent noses up. If you're headed to the Middle Provo there are still a fair number of Western Weedy Water Sedges in addition to the BWO's you should also be prepared for. These are normally more of a late September and October hatch that also didn't get going till late into the fall season. \r\n\r\nWith it cooling off and they're being a few more clouds around I think a few good afternoons still remain. Although it's not going to get very cold after a brief storm hits us, overall conditions will be good for what fishing remains in November: mild and overcast.  If you're looking for a little guidance on which section of the Provo to fish, you'll find the Middle in the best shape.  The Lower Provo remains off color and has a fair amount of weed growth, which is hampering some of the fly-fishing opportunities you'll have. That said, there are fewer people to contend with on the Lower and there are some fish to be caught.         \r\n   \r\nBlue wings are running quite small in size on both sections of the Provo; #22-#24.  You can get away with #22 for the most part, but on sunny days you might have to fish the smaller of the two.  Sparse patterns are also important to your success.  Using 7X will improve your luck, especially on days where they're a fair amount of sunshine.  If you don't currently have some 7X we're all on the RIO's Power Flex Plus bandwagon.  We all fished this stuff in the winter on small midge patterns and it proved it's worth. It's almost as strong as standard 6X. If you enjoy winter fly-fishing you'll also find this stuff in 7X useful to have.\r\n\r\nOn a cloudy day you can get away with a larger pattern and larger tippet sizes generally, but if you can manage a smaller fly without getting frustrated you'll consistently have better success and stick some of the nicer browns that are keying on Novembers mayfly hatches. If you have trouble seeing small dun and emerger patterns try using a larger parachute for a lead fly and drop your smaller patterns about 12\" off the bend of the hook with 6X or 7X tippet.  As I mentioned a caddis pattern or Parachute Adams would be good patterns to consider. \r\n\r\nAs your day unfolds on the Provo you'll find streamers or nymphs working the best early on in the day.  A note to that, things are happening an hour earlier than they were prior to Daylight Savings.  Take note.....As you start to see rises, Soft Hackles, emergers or BWO dun patterns will work.  Nymphs will also work once the hatch gets underway, but for all of us at the shop we definitely find it a challenge fishing anything other than a dry fly when this and other rivers trout are rising.  So regardless of what technique you enjoy, you're going to have some opportunities.  Again, the fishing may be challenging, but casting to a rising trout definitely beats working.   Remember as you take a photo or two of your successes to #keepemwet. \r\n\r\nGreen River:      \r\nThe Green is probably fishing the best of all our fisheries and with this weather pattern it's a pretty easy trek compared to most Novembers.  If you're looking for some solitude, you'll probably have the place to yourself.  I know all the Western Rivers guides are fishing and exploring other waters so are most of the other guide services.  \r\n\r\nWater levels remain unchanged and are in good shape whether you wade or float the Green. If you read the flow section of this report you know that flows are about 1100 cfs.  This is a very nice flow for wading and although the river will be a little boney for floating, it's still at a very good level for November.  \r\n\r\nBlue Wing and midge hatches will generate good late morning and early afternoon rises, especially if you can get a day when there are some clouds around. And compared to my last report this weather forecast has a little more of that in the forecast. Even though these fish haven't been hit very hard this fall, the bugs are small and on sunny days that will make for more of a challenge.  Not only will you see larger fish getting on the mayfly and midge hatches, but you'll find them more willing to take you fly when it's overcast. There's some moisture around, so if you do head over take your time and be aware that there may be some icy roads.  Generally this alone will keep most from making the trek, but it shouldn't. \r\n\r\nI believe those wade fishing will be able to take the best advantage of the Green's hatches and those dry fly fishing opportunities. Since we're fishing such small dry flies now it's easier to target those trout that are rising and find your fly since you don't or shouldn't be casting all that far. Long fine leaders and tippets will be a must for your success. Leaders should be at least 9', however if you can turn over a longer leader you'll do even better.  When fishing flies this small I prefer to use 4' of tippet if I'm adding tippet to a leader, which I typically do.  If it's a new leader I'll cut off about 18\"-24\" of the tippet end then add 4' of what ever leader material I'm using.  Currently that's Power Flex Plus.  Good stuff, but I know that we all have our individual preferences for leader and tippet material.   \r\n\r\nIf you're not into fishing dry flies or get frustrated with fishing such small dry flies, you'll find life a little easier working Zebra Midges and a variety of small baetis nymphs either as droppers or deep nymphing. You can either deep nymph with an indicator or you will do quite well fishing a dry fly and a dropper. \r\n\r\nThose who enjoy fishing streamers will find they work best while drifting the river. You simply get better presentation when floating a river when you're working streamers or for that matter drifting nymphs, dry fly and a dropper or big foam flies. On these sunny November days look to have the best success stripping streamers early and late or on portions of the river where the canyon walls keep the sun from the water.  We've got some cloudy and cooler days in the forecast and similar to dry fly fishing these will also be your best streamer days.  Dress warm!  If you have a 200 or 150gr, 18'- 24' shooting head you'll find these lines are ideal for streamers on the Green.  These lines compared to traditional 10'-15' sink-tips are very easy to cast and make fishing some of the larger articulated streamers that we fish much more enjoyable and they simply fish better.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for some river solitude, I'd put the Green on your list. It's almost a different river from it's summer scene and one were very fond of.  You'll have to work for your fish, but you'll find them worth your efforts.  Looking at the upcoming weather forecast you'll want to take your time on the drive.  Roads may be a little slippery, so drive carefully.    "
